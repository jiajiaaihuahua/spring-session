= Spring Session - Spring Boot
Rob Winch, Vedran PaviÄ‡
:toc:

This guide describes how to use Spring Session to transparently leverage a relational database to back a web application's `HttpSession` when using Spring Boot.

NOTE: The completed guide can be found in the <<httpsession-jdbc-boot-sample, httpsession-jdbc-boot sample application>>.

== Updating Dependencies
Before you use Spring Session, you must ensure to update your dependencies.
We assume you are working with a working Spring Boot web application.
If you are using Maven, ensure to add the following dependencies:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependencies>
	<!-- ... -->

	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.springframework.session</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-session-jdbc</artifactId>
	</dependency>
</dependencies>
----

Spring Boot provides dependency management for Spring Session modules, so there's no need to explicitly declare dependency version.

// tag::config[]

[[httpsession-jdbc-boot-spring-configuration]]
== Spring Boot Configuration

After adding the required dependencies, we can create our Spring Boot configuration.
Thanks to first-class auto configuration support, setting up Spring Session backed by a relational database is as simple as adding a single configuration property to your `application.properties`:

.src/main/resources/application.properties
----
spring.session.store-type=jdbc
----

Under the hood, Spring Boot will apply configuration that is equivalent to manually adding `@EnableJdbcHttpSession` annotation.
This creates a Spring Bean with the name of `springSessionRepositoryFilter` that implements Filter.
The filter is what is in charge of replacing the `HttpSession` implementation to be backed by Spring Session.

Further customization is possible using `application.properties`:

.src/main/resources/application.properties
----
server.session.timeout= # Session timeout in seconds.
spring.session.jdbc.initializer.enabled= # Create the required session tables on startup if necessary. Enabled automatically if the default table name is set or a custom schema is configured.
spring.session.jdbc.schema=classpath:org/springframework/session/jdbc/schema-@@platform@@.sql # Path to the SQL file to use to initialize the database schema.
spring.session.jdbc.table-name=SPRING_SESSION # Name of database table used to store sessions.
----

== Configuring the DataSource

Spring Boot automatically creates a `DataSource` that connects Spring Session to an embedded instance of H2 database.
In a production environment you need to ensure to update your configuration to point to your relational database.
For example, you can include the following in your *application.properties*

.src/main/resources/application.properties
----
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/myapp
spring.datasource.username=myapp
spring.datasource.password=secret
----

For more information, refer to http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/{spring-boot-version}/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-configure-datasource[Configure a DataSource] portion of the Spring Boot documentation.

[[httpsession-jdbc-boot-servlet-configuration]]
== Servlet Container Initialization

Our <<httpsession-jdbc-boot-spring-configuration,Spring Boot Configuration>> created a Spring Bean named `springSessionRepositoryFilter` that implements `Filter`.
The `springSessionRepositoryFilter` bean is responsible for replacing the `HttpSession` with a custom implementation that is backed by Spring Session.

In order for our `Filter` to do its magic, Spring needs to load our `Config` class.
Last we need to ensure that our Servlet Container (i.e. Tomcat) uses our `springSessionRepositoryFilter` for every request.
Fortunately, Spring Boot takes care of both of these steps for us.

// end::config[]

[[httpsession-jdbc-boot-sample]]
== httpsession-jdbc-boot Sample Application

The httpsession-jdbc-boot Sample Application demonstrates how to use Spring Session to transparently leverage H2 database to back a web application's `HttpSession` when using Spring Boot.

[[httpsession-jdbc-boot-running]]
=== Running the httpsession-jdbc-boot Sample Application

You can run the sample by obtaining the {download-url}[source code] and invoking the following command:

----
$ ./gradlew :samples:httpsession-jdbc-boot:bootRun
----

You should now be able to access the application at http://localhost:8080/

[[httpsession-jdbc-boot-explore]]
=== Exploring the security Sample Application

Try using the application. Enter the following to log in:

* **Username** _user_
* **Password** _password_

Now click the **Login** button.
You should now see a message indicating your are logged in with the user entered previously.
The user's information is stored in H2 database rather than Tomcat's `HttpSession` implementation.

[[httpsession-jdbc-boot-how]]
=== How does it work?

Instead of using Tomcat's `HttpSession`, we are actually persisting the values in H2 database.
Spring Session replaces the `HttpSession` with an implementation that is backed by a relational database.
When Spring Security's `SecurityContextPersistenceFilter` saves the `SecurityContext` to the `HttpSession` it is then persisted into H2 database.

When a new `HttpSession` is created, Spring Session creates a cookie named SESSION in your browser that contains the id of your session.
Go ahead and view the cookies (click for help with https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/resources#cookies[Chrome] or https://getfirebug.com/wiki/index.php/Cookies_Panel#Cookies_List[Firefox]).

If you like, you can easily remove the session using H2 web console available at: http://localhost:8080/h2-console/ (use `jdbc:h2:mem:testdb` for JDBC URL)

Now visit the application at http://localhost:8080/ and observe that we are no longer authenticated.
