= Spring Session - WebSocket

This guide describes how to use Spring Session to ensure that WebSocket messages keep your HttpSession alive.

// tag::disclaimer[]

NOTE: Spring Session's WebSocket support only works with Spring's WebSocket support.
Specifically it does not work with using https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=356[JSR-356] directly.
This is due to the fact that JSR-356 does not have a mechanism for intercepting incoming WebSocket messages.

== HttpSession Setup

The first step is to integrate Spring Session with the HttpSession. These steps are already outlined in the link:httpsession.html[HttpSession Guide].

Please make sure you have already integrated Spring Session with the HttpSession before proceeding.

== Spring Configuration

In a typical Spring WebSocket application users would extend `AbstractWebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer`.
For example, the configuration might look something like the following:

[source,java]
----
include::{websocketdoc-test-dir}WebSocketConfig.java[tags=class]
----

We can easily update our configuration to use Spring Session's WebSocket support.
For example:

.src/main/java/samples/config/WebSocketConfig.java
[source,java]
----
include::{samples-dir}boot/websocket/src/main/java/sample/config/WebSocketConfig.java[tags=class]
----

To hook in the Spring Session support we only need to change two things:

<1> Instead of extending `AbstractWebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer` we extend `AbstractSessionWebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer`
<2> We rename the `registerStompEndpoints` method to `configureStompEndpoints`

What does `AbstractSessionWebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer` do behind the scenes?

* `WebSocketConnectHandlerDecoratorFactory` is added as a `WebSocketHandlerDecoratorFactory` to `WebSocketTransportRegistration`.
This ensures a custom `SessionConnectEvent` is fired that contains the `WebSocketSession`.
The `WebSocketSession` is necessary to terminate any WebSocket connections that are still open when a Spring Session is terminated.
* `SessionRepositoryMessageInterceptor` is added as a `HandshakeInterceptor` to every `StompWebSocketEndpointRegistration`.
This ensures that the Session is added to the WebSocket properties to enable updating the last accessed time.
* `SessionRepositoryMessageInterceptor` is added as a `ChannelInterceptor` to our inbound `ChannelRegistration`.
This ensures that every time an inbound message is received, that the last accessed time of our Spring Session is updated.
* `WebSocketRegistryListener` is created as a Spring Bean.
This ensures that we have a mapping of all of the Session id to the corresponding WebSocket connections.
By maintaining this mapping, we can close all the WebSocket connections when a Spring Session (HttpSession) is terminated.

[[websocket-sample]]
== websocket Sample Application

The websocket sample application demonstrates how to use Spring Session with WebSockets.

=== Running the websocket Sample Application

You can run the sample by obtaining the {download-url}[source code] and invoking the following command:

[TIP]
====
For the purposes of testing session expiration, you may want to change the session expiration to be 1 minute (default is 30 minutes) by adding the following configuration property starting before the application:

.src/main/resources/application.properties
----
server.session.timeout=60
----
====

[NOTE]
====
For the sample to work, you must http://redis.io/download[install Redis 2.8+] on localhost and run it with the default port (6379).
Alternatively, you can update the `RedisConnectionFactory` to point to a Redis server.
Another option is to use https://www.docker.com/[Docker] to run Redis on localhost. See https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/[Docker Redis repository] for detailed instructions.
====

----
$ ./gradlew :samples:websocket:bootRun
----

You should now be able to access the application at http://localhost:8080/

=== Exploring the websocket Sample Application

Try using the application. Authenticate with the following information:

* **Username** _rob_
* **Password** _password_

Now click the **Login** button. You should now be authenticated as the user **rob**.

Open an incognito window and access http://localhost:8080/

You will be prompted with a log in form. Authenticate with the following information:

* **Username** _luke_
* **Password** _password_

Now send a message from *rob* to *luke*. The message should appear.

Wait for two minutes and try sending a message from *rob* to *luke* again.
You will see that the message is no longer sent.

[NOTE]
.Why two minutes?
====
Spring Session will expire in 60 seconds, but the notification from Redis is not guaranteed to happen within 60 seconds.
To ensure the socket is closed in a reasonable amount of time, Spring Session runs a background task every minute at 00 seconds that forcibly cleans up any expired sessions.
This means you will need to wait at most two minutes before the WebSocket connection is terminated.
====

Try accessing http://localhost:8080/
You will be prompted to authenticate again.
This demonstrates that the session properly expires.

Now repeat the same exercise, but instead of waiting two minutes send a message from *each* of the users every 30 seconds.
You will see that the messages continue to be sent.
Try accessing http://localhost:8080/
You will not be prompted to authenticate again.
This demonstrates the session is kept alive.

NOTE: Only messages sent from a user keep the session alive.
This is because only messages coming from a user imply user activity.
Messages received do not imply activity and thus do not renew the session expiration.
